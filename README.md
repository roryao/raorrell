Hi, I'm Rory. #

I'm a highly numerate, Physics graduate - interested in data, new technology, sustainability and the environment.
I'm working on increasing my data science and analysis capabilities, which I will be doing here. 
In addition to this I am writing a fantasy novel, which I may incorporate here as well. I have been working on it for a long time however, so don't expect many regular updates. 


This is my first Github Repository. Let's see how it develops.
